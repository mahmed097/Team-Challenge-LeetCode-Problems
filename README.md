# LeetCode Algorithm Challenges

This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic challenges from LeetCode, implemented in Java. It serves as a resource for learning, practicing, and mastering data structures and algorithms through practical coding exercises. The project is broken down into different packages with each containing a Java file named after the corresponding LeetCode problem.

Challenge 1: [Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-salary-excluding-the-minimum-and-maximum-salary/description/)

Challenge 2: [Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/description/)

Challenge 3: [Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/)

Challenge 4: [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

Challenge 5: [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/)

This algorithm takes two Array lists, list1 and list2, where the elements in each list are sorted in non-decreasing order, the task is to merge them into a single Array list such that the merged list remains sorted. The algorithm achieves this by comparing elements from both lists iteratively.

Constraints:

- The number of elements in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
- -100 <= element <= 100
- Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Examples:

- Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4] Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
- Input: list1 = [], list2 = [] Output: []
- Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0] Output: [0]
